# Auditorium_Reservation
Project that using file I/O to manage a ticketing system for a movie theater

C++ GotG(Guardians of the Galaxy) Reservation: My goal with this project was to show my understanding of the language c++. This project uses linked lists for the auditoriums, operator overrides, pointer manipulation, file manipulation, and dynamic memory.

C# MovieSub: I reused the Movie Ticketing Project as an early learning project for C#
